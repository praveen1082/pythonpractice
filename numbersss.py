# in python there are two types of numbers integers and floating point numbers

print(10 ** 3)
print(10 * 3)
print(10/3)
print(10//3)
print(10%3)
# augmented / enhanced assignment operator

x = 10
x += 3
print(x)

#operator precedence
x = 10 + 3 * 2
print(x)

"""exponentiation,multiply or divide, add or subtract"""

# using parenthesis provides a precendence
#exercise by mosh
# what is the output of x = (2+3)*10-3 =47
x = (2+3)*10-3;
print(x)

#yahoo!! answer is correct

x = -2.9
print(round(x))
print(abs(x))
